Goldilocks and the Four Bears

Once upon a time, there lived a family of bears. A mama bear, a papa bear, and a baby bear.

One day, they made hot dogs for breakfast, but it was too hot to eat. So, they decided to take a walk.

While they were gone, a girl named Goldilocks came to the three bears' home. Nobody answered the door, so she walked in.

On the kitchen table, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry, so she decided to have a taste.
