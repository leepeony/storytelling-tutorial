# Cloning a Git repo

#### The repo on Github is the "remote", and the repo on your machine is the "local". You'll need to pull remote to your computer to work on it.

- go to the directory you keep your git repos. I keep mine in `~/git`.

- use the command <kbd>git clone [your repo's web URL] </kbd>.

- you should be able to see your local Git repo in that directory. Open it up and poke around.
